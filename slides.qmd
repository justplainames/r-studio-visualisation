## Purpose of this presentation

The purpose of this presentation is to examine the relationship between indicators of good health and well-being, specifically targeting the reduction of deaths and illnesses caused by hazardous chemicals, air, water, soil pollution, and contamination. 

The presentation will explore the significance of these indicators and potential strategies for achieving improvements in this area.


## Research Questions

- To what extent does exposure to hazardous chemicals and pollution influence mortality and illness rates?
- Specifically, what is the relationship between access to safe and affordable drinking water and the proportion of population using safe drinking water services?
- How does the availability of sanitation and hygiene facilities, particularly targeting women, affect the mortality rate attributed to unsafe water and hygiene?
- What are the key factors contributing to unintentional poisoning mortality, and how can they be mitigated?

## Importance of this research

- *Public health impact* <br>
  Addresses hazardous chemicals, pollution, and unsafe water's effect on mortality and illness rates.

- *Sustainable Development Goals* <br>
  Supports Goal 3 by focusing on reducing deaths and illnesses from pollution.

- *Policy implications* <br>
  Informs targeted strategies to address health risks.

- *Well-being enhancement* <br>
  Contributes to promoting healthier lives and well-being.


## UN Sustainable Development Goals

Health and water indicators are related to Goals 3 and 6.

## UN Targets Addressed

- *Good Health and Well-being*

  - Target 3.9: Reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and contamination

- *Clean Water and Sanitation*
  - Target 6.1: Achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all
  - Target 6.2: Achieve adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene targeting women


## Selected Indicators

- Target 3.9.2: Mortality rate attributed to unsafe water, unsafe sanitation and lack of hygiene (exposure to unsafe Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for All (WASH) services) 
- Target 3.9.3: Mortality rate attributed to unintentional poisoning 
- Target 6.1.1: Proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services 
- Target 6.2.1: Proportion of population using (a) safely managed sanitation services and (b) a hand-washing facility with soap and water

## $\textit{k}$-Means Clustering

Considering the four selected Sustainable Development Goals, what is an appropriate number, $\textit{k}$, of clusters for countries?

::: columns

::: {.column width="35%"}
*diagram here*
:::

::: {.column width="3%"}
:::

::: {.column width="62%"}
The 'xxx' suggests $k=3$ or $k=4$.

We choose $k=3$, but this decision is admittedly subjective.

## Decision Tree

Can the cluster assignment be predicted based on the country’s income group, population size and region according to the 7-class World Bank categorisation?

*diagram here*


## Evaluation of Decision Tree

::: {style="color: red;"}
CHANGE THIS
:::

The decision tree does not assign any country to cluster 2 (low education and high political representation).

Ten-fold cross validation indicates that the decision tree has a low accuracy of 0.65.

The relative importance of the predictors for classification are as follows:

- Income group: 100
- Region: 60.55
- Population size: 9.07


## Summary of Quantitative Results

- Strong positive correlations exist between indicators for the same goal.
- Moderate but statistically significant correlations are observed between indicators for different goals.
- The country’s income group and region may moderately influence female participation in education and politics.
- Population size does not have a significant impact.
- Many missing. Only 72 countries have data for all four indicators.


## Policy Implications

- Education and gender equality indicators are interconnected.
- Promote gender equality in both national and local political institutions because both levels are strongly correlated.
- Tailor interventions to address specific challenges in different income groups and regions.
- Support countries in improving data collection for evidence-based policymaking.
